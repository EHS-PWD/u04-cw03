### **Challenge 1: Basic Styling with Classes and IDs**  
**Task:**  
1. Create an HTML file with the following elements:  
   - A main header (`<h1>`) with the ID `#main-header`.  
   - A paragraph (`<p>`) with the class `.intro-text`.  
   - A button (`<button>`) with the class `.btn`.  

2. Create a CSS file and write the following rules set:
   - Style the `#main-header` with a font size of 36px and a text color of navy.  
   - Style the `.intro-text` with a font size of 18px and line height of 1.6.  
   - Style the `.btn` with a background color of lightblue, padding of 10px, and rounded corners.  


### **Challenge 2: Adding Interactivity with Pseudo-Classes**  
**Task:**  
Continue to add pseudo-class rules to in the CSS file:  
   - Change the text color of the `.btn` to darkblue when the user hovers over it (`:hover`).  
   - Change the background color of the `.btn` to darkgreen when clicked (`:active`).  
   - Underline links (`<a>`) only when hovered (`:hover`).  


### **Challenge 3: Advanced Styling with Pseudo-Elements**  
**Task:**  
1. Add a blockquote (`<blockquote>`) with a famous quote to your page.  
2. Use pseudo-elements to:  
   - Add the text `"Quote: "` before the blockquote using `::before`.  
   - Add the author's name after the blockquote using `::after` (e.g., `" - Author Name"`).  
3. Style the first letter of the paragraph in `.intro-text` to be bold, red, and larger than the rest of the text using `::first-letter`.


### **Challenge 4: Combining Classes, IDs, and Pseudo-Classes**  
**Task:**  
1. Add a navigation bar (`<nav>`) to your page with three links: Home, About, Contact.  
2. Style the navigation bar:  
   - Use a class `.nav-link` to give all links a blue color and padding of 5px.  
   - Highlight the current pageâ€™s link (e.g., Home) using an ID `#current-page`.  
3. Add a hover effect to all `.nav-link` elements to change their background to lightgray.

**Bonus:** Use the `:nth-child()` pseudo-class to give the first link a bold font.
