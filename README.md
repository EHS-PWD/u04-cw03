### **Lesson Classwork: Classes, IDs, Pseudo-Classes, and Pseudo-Elements**

**Objective:**  
Students will apply their knowledge of classes, IDs, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements through a series of coding challenges to reinforce understanding of CSS selectors, interactivity, and targeted styling.

### **Instructions for Completing the Coding Challenges**

1. **Folder Structure:**  
   - Follow the instructions or prompts provided in the challenge > READ-challenges.md to complete the task.

2. **Test Your Code in the Browser:**  
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the output.  
   - Test all styles, interactions (e.g., hover effects), and pseudo-element changes to ensure they work as expected.

3. **Fix Errors and Validate Your Code:**  
   - Use the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check for HTML errors.  
   - Use the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to ensure your CSS is valid.  

4. **Experiment and Explore:**  
   - Try modifying existing styles or adding new ones to see how they affect the output.  
   - For additional resources and examples, visit [W3Schools CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/).

5. **Bonus Challenges:**  
   - If you finish early, explore the **bonus challenge** tasks in the folder.  
   - Use pseudo-classes like `:hover`, `:nth-child`, or pseudo-elements like `::before` and `::after` to enhance your designs creatively.

### **Remember:**  
- Focus on **understanding** how classes, IDs, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements work.  
- If you get stuck, don’t hesitate to ask for help—CSS is all about experimenting and problem-solving.  

Happy coding!
